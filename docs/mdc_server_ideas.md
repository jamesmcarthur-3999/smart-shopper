# Smart Shopper MDC Server Ideas

This document maintains a backlog of potential future MCP tools and capabilities for the Smart Shopper application. Each entry includes the date it was proposed, a brief description, and potential implementation considerations.

## Future MCP Tool Ideas

### Product Data Enrichment

- **2025-04-21** - **Review Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze product reviews to extract sentiment scores and key pros/cons. Could use a fine-tuned language model or sentiment analysis API.

- **2025-04-21** - **Price History Tracker**: Add historical price data to products to show trends and identify good deals. Would require integrating with a price tracking API or building a database to store historical prices.

- **2025-04-21** - **Similar Product Finder**: Given a product, find visually or functionally similar alternatives. Could use vector embeddings of product descriptions and images.

### Search Enhancement

- **2025-04-21** - **Multi-Modal Search**: Allow users to upload images to find visually similar products. Would require integration with a visual search API or building a custom image vectorization system.

- **2025-04-21** - **Personal Style Profile**: Develop a style profile for users based on previous searches and preferences. Could use collaborative filtering or a recommendation system.

- **2025-04-21** - **Semantic Query Expansion**: Automatically expand search queries with semantically related terms to improve recall. Could use word embeddings or a knowledge graph.

### User Experience

- **2025-04-21** - **Price Drop Alerts**: Allow users to set alerts for when product prices drop below a certain threshold. Would require a persistent database and notification system.

- **2025-04-21** - **Size Recommendation Engine**: Based on previous purchases or provided measurements, recommend sizes across different brands. Would require a database of brand sizing information.

- **2025-04-21** - **AR Product Visualization**: Allow users to visualize products in their environment using AR. Would require integration with AR frameworks and 3D product models.

### Integration Opportunities

- **2025-04-21** - **Retailer-Specific Adapters**: Create specialized adapters for major retailers to directly access their catalog and pricing data. Would require individual API integrations or specialized scraping approaches.

- **2025-04-21** - **Social Shopping Integration**: Allow users to share product discoveries and get feedback from friends. Would require building social features or integrating with existing social platforms.

- **2025-04-21** - **Wishlist Synchronization**: Sync user wishlists across multiple retailers. Would require OAuth integrations with retailer accounts.

### Backend Enhancements

- **2025-04-21** - **Query Intent Classifier**: Pre-classify user queries to optimize which tools are called. Could use a simple classifier trained on shopping query patterns.

- **2025-04-21** - **Result Caching System**: Implement a more sophisticated caching system with TTL and partial invalidation. Would improve performance for common queries.

- **2025-04-21** - **Federated Product Database**: Build a local product database that aggregates results from multiple sources for faster retrieval. Would require regular updates and deduplication logic.

## Implementation Prioritization Criteria

When considering which tools to implement next, evaluate based on:

1. **User Impact**: How significantly would this improve the shopping experience?
2. **Technical Feasibility**: How complex is the implementation?
3. **Data Availability**: Are the necessary data sources accessible?
4. **Performance Impact**: Would this help or hinder our 1-second latency target?
5. **Resource Requirements**: What ongoing maintenance would this require?

## Adding New Ideas

When adding new ideas to this document:

1. Add the current date in **YYYY-MM-DD** format
2. Provide a clear, concise title
3. Include a brief description of the functionality
4. Note any specific implementation considerations
5. Use the `github.update_file` MCP tool to update this document with a patch diff
