# Smart Shopper - AI-Powered Shopping Assistant

Smart Shopper is an AI-powered shopping assistant that leverages Claude and custom MCP tools to provide intelligent product recommendations, comparisons, and enriched information - all within 1 second of a user query.

## Core Features

- **Natural Language Shopping**: Users express their shopping needs conversationally
- **Sub-Second Response**: All recommendations appear within 1 second
- **Rich Visual Experience**: Products displayed in customizable, interactive layouts
- **Data-Enriched Results**: Product data enhanced with reviews, comparisons, and context
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Claude analyzes results and provides insights

## Technical Architecture

Smart Shopper is built on a Model Context Protocol (MCP) architecture with these key components:

1. **Claude AI**: Powers natural language understanding and coordinates the shopping experience
2. **MCP Tool Stack**: Custom servers that securely access external APIs for product data:
   - SerpAPI for Google Shopping results
   - Search1API for product indexing
   - Perplexity for enrichment and context
3. **Canvas Operations**: Interactive display for product cards, comparisons, and galleries
4. **React Frontend**: Modern UI for natural language input and product display
